Temporary backlog
-------
1. Make the FluentMessage able to write "The given value(s)" instead of "the expected enumerable". 
1. Make the NumberCheck not implementing the ICheck anymore.
1. Continue to migrate to the new error message formats (next: ?).
1. Add some check method to the comparable types (e.g. IsAfter()).
1. Expose IComparable extension methods to 'number' values so that autocompletion works on number values with those comparable checks.
1. Reached 100% coverage on NFluent.dll
1. Improved formatting of type's names
1. Improved signature generation and Documentation related tests
