* Supports nullables for all the number types (int, long, double, decimal, byte, uint, ...) 
New features
============
 - New extensible syntax for Check.That(IEnumerable xxx).Contains(...) that permits to add suffixes narrowing the conditions.
    E.g. Check.That(IEnumerable xxx).Contains(...).InThatOrder(). Possible suffixes:
	- Only(): raises if the enumerable contains items that were not listed in Contains. 
		E.G: Check.That( new []{1,2,3,4}).Contains(new [] {1,2,3}).Only() fails due to '4' being present.
	- Once(): raises if the enumerable contains expected items more than once.
		E.G: Check.That( new []{1,2,3,2}).Contains(new [] {1,2,3}).Once() fails due to '2' being present twice.
	- InThatOrder(): raises if the enumerable does not contain expected items in the listed order.
		E.G: Check.That( new []{1,3,2}).Contains(new [] {1,2,3}).InThatOrder() fails due to '2' and '3' being inversed.
