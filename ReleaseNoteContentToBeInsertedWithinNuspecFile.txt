New feature(s):

--------------
Change(s):
* Numbers: introduce IsGreaterThanZero() as a substitute for IsPositive() which is now obsolete.
* Improve error messages (consistency and relevance)
* Check.ThatCode(...).Throws&lt;T&gt;() now requires T to be an exception. This restriction ensures only Exceptions are proposed in autocompletion.
* Simplify the way you can extend NFluent by adding your own checks. Now, you can call: var checker = ExtensibilityHelper.ExtractChecker(check);  at the beginning of your check extension method, and then rely on its ExecuteCheck() or BuildMessage() helper methods to do the job. Note: the Checker is part of the NFluent.Extensibility namespace.

--------------
Bug Fixe(s):
* Fix the inversion between expected and actual error message for the .WithMessage checks on exception.
* Fix the issue with null value on Check.That(...).IsBefore(...)
